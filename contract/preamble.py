"""Canonical contract preamble — the one true copy of the shared plumbing.

Every capability CLI (`capabilities/<name>/bin/<name>`) carries an identical copy
of the helpers between the fence markers below. They are COPIED, never imported:
each `bin/<name>` stays a single self-contained file runnable by `uv run` with no
sibling imports, so a manager update can never break a deployed capability
(SHEBANG.md "spec, never a shared runtime library"; DOCTRINE rule 15).

`capabilities sync-contract` stamps the fenced interior of this file into every
capability; `capabilities audit` byte-compares each script's fenced block to this
one and fails on drift. There is no per-function override mechanism — after the
deviation pre-clean the common set is uniform, so each fence is all-or-nothing and
the drift-check is strict.

THREE TIERS
===========
The contract has three fenced regions; the store tier is canonical in
`contract/store.py` because it is also imported by bundled services:

  - **capability core** — the capability declaration surface (summary/manifest,
    references, guide, ids) plus the file/project/IO plumbing. EVERY capability
    carries it, connection-bearing or not.

  - **store** — the records adapter used by identifiers, policy, settings and
    operational state. EVERY capability carries it because core calls into it.

  - **connections** — the credential cascade and connection resolver. Only a
    capability that implements connections carries this fence. Omitting it is the
    normal state for a connection-less capability.

A capability's archetype (API / CLI-wrapper / web-session) lives in the connections
tier; a connection-less capability has no archetype because it has no connection.

WHAT EACH CAPABILITY MUST DEFINE *ABOVE* THE FENCES (the vendored blocks read
these module-level names; they are the only coupling):
    core/store:  NAME, SUMMARY, SCOPE, DOCS_BASE, STATE, INVENTORY,
                 POST_INSTALL, _CONFIG_HOME, _STATE_HOME
    connections: CREDENTIALS_ENV, CRED_KEYS, WRITE_VERBS, WRITE_DEFAULT
    plus the stdlib imports the helpers use: os, sys, json, Path, NoReturn.
Optionally, beside WRITE_DEFAULT, `MACHINE_READS`: a tuple of the read verbs
that, outside any project, use the machine's own connections read-only.
Absent or empty means none; the manager validates it where it validates a
capability.

The bare `help` verb is dispatched by `_contract` and reads the CLI's help
body from a module-level `HELP` constant if defined, else the module docstring
(`__doc__`) — either wire is acceptable, and every capability already carries
one or the other. It then appends the project's identifiers as a labelled
section rendered by `_render_ids_markdown` (the same format the manager's
`capabilities ids <NAME>` produces, so one home for the rendering).

`_contract`'s `inventory` verb calls `_inventory(network)` only when the
capability declares `INVENTORY`; that builder is per-capability and stays OUTSIDE
the fences, while the envelope, the flag parsing and the empty answer are vendored
so every capability reports in one shape.

`_contract`'s `connections` verb calls `_cmd_connections`, and every capability
defines its own `_cmd_connections` (its no-registry branch names that capability's
own primary key, or reports "no connections" for a core-only capability) — so
`_cmd_connections` stays OUTSIDE the fences, per capability. Likewise per-capability
(shape varies, never vendored): `_build_conn`/`_load_config`, `_resolve_conn`,
`_check_connection`, the doctor command, the declaration constants, the domain
verbs, argparse/`main`.

TWO DELIBERATE BEST-OF-BREED CHOICES baked into the canonical bodies below:
  - `_emit` is the empty-string-guarded variant (asana/callva/notion/telegram).
  - `_select_connection` also matches a connection by its own `address` field
    (generalized from mailbox); the loop never fires for connections without an
    `address`, so it is a no-op for every other capability.

This file is documentation above the opening fences; the codegen stamps only the
interiors. Edit the helpers here, then run `capabilities sync-contract`.
