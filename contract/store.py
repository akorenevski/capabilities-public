"""Canonical store tier — the one true copy of the shared persistence layer.

This is the required persistence tier alongside `capability core` and the
optional `connections` tier in
`contract/preamble.py`, and it obeys the same law: the helpers between the fence
markers are COPIED into each `bin/<name>`, never imported, so a manager update
can never break a deployed capability (SHEBANG.md "spec, never a shared runtime
library"). Every capability carries it because the core identifiers and policy
surface resolve through the records adapter.

WHAT THIS TIER OWNS
===================
The records a *running* capability reads and writes: connections, identifiers,
settings, the policy gate, and operational state. It does not own authoring
material — a guide, a reference, a doctrine file — which versions in lockstep
with the code that it describes and stays in the repository.

The test is whether the material must change on a deployed host *without* a
redeploy. A channel prompt served per request: yes. A capability's own guide:
no, it is meaningless apart from the version of the code that ships it.

THREE RESOLUTION SEMANTICS, ALREADY IN THE DOCTRINE
===================================================
Scope is a column here, not a directory, and it has two values: a record
belongs to one project or to every project, and `project_id` is null in the
second case. The precedence is always project over global, but *how* the
scopes combine is declared per collection, because the standing rules already
contain two different answers and one collection needs a third:

  - MERGE  — per key; a key absent at the higher scope inherits the lower.
    This is rule 17 for the gate ("an absent project entry inherits the global
    entry"), and it is what makes a scope worth having at all. Connections
    take it too, at the entry level: rule 18 keeps an identity atomic — taken
    whole from one scope, never assembled out of two — while letting a project
    add to the set it inherits rather than replace it.

  - FIRST  — the highest scope holding ANY entry wins, whole. Nothing takes
    it by default; it is here for the project that must not see the global
    set at all, where a personal connection showing through would be wrong.

  - EXACT  — no cascade; a record belongs to exactly one scope and is read
    there. This is rule 16: state follows the scope of the credentials that
    minted it, so the global scope is not a fallback for a project's.

ONE WRITER PER SHARED FILE BECOMES ONE WRITER PER COLLECTION
============================================================
Rule 15 survives the move intact, addressed by `(capability, collection)`
instead of by path: the manager alone writes `policy`, a capability alone
writes its own `identifier` and `state` rows, and `connection` and `setting`
rows are human-written through a CLI verb. The `revisions` table records who
wrote what, which is what the repository's history provided before.

MIGRATIONS ARE ADDITIVE
=======================
Two hosts running different versions of the same capability will share one
database. A column added by a newer version must therefore be readable-by-
absence to the older one: expand in one release, contract only in a later
release that no live host predates. `migrate()` refuses to run a step that
drops or narrows, so the rule is mechanical rather than remembered.

EXCEPTIONS ARE RAISED, NEVER PRINTED
====================================
This tier is a library, not a command. It raises `StoreError`; the carrying
capability maps that onto its own `_die` envelope and exit codes, so the error
surface stays the capability's own.
