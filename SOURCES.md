# Capability source repositories

A managed capability has one editable source and three derived copies. Keep
these roles separate:

| Role | Canonical path | Editable |
|---|---|---|
| Author workspace | `~/.capabilities/sources/<source-id>/` | yes |
| Remote source cache | `~/.cache/capabilities/sources/<source-id>/` | no |
| Installed payload | `~/.capabilities/<name>/` | no |
| Consuming-project envelope | `<project>/capabilities/<name>/` | configuration only |

The workspace root is fixed by the manager under `CAPABILITIES_HOME` (default
`~/.capabilities`). Source commits and pushes happen only there. Registry
payloads, remote caches, and project envelopes are never capability source
code. The name `sources` is reserved and cannot be used as a capability name.

When a consuming project needs a short-lived integration loop against a Git
capability source, use `capabilities dev` instead of moving or editing this
canonical workspace in place. The dev lifecycle creates an isolated source
worktree and runtime registry while leaving the source checkout and normal
installation untouched. `capabilities guide dev` owns that workflow.

The manager owns the source registry at
`~/.config/capabilities/sources.json` (or the platform's `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
equivalent). Its stable shape is:

```json
{
  "sources": {
    "team": {
      "kind": "git",
      "url": "git@github.com:alice/team-capabilities.git",
      "ref": "main"
    }
  }
}
```

Use `source init`, `source clone`, `source add`, and `source remove` to change
it rather than editing it. `capabilities source list` is the supported way to
inspect both this registry and the built-in `official` source.

## Create and release a source

```sh
capabilities source init personal \
  --remote git@github.com:alice/my-capabilities.git
cd ~/.capabilities/sources/personal
capabilities new my-service --source personal
```

`source init` initializes git, registers the source, vendors the current
authoring contract, and creates host-readable authoring instructions. `new`
creates the canonical `capabilities/<name>/bin/<name>` bundle and stamps the
generated contract regions. Never edit those fenced regions by hand.

The release unit is a prepared Git commit. Run `capabilities guide publishing`
for the live staged-index, immutable verification, and release transaction.
The manager leaves commit scope and message to the author, then owns publication,
checkout synchronization, and local installed-payload reconciliation. Validation
is explicit locally and authoritative in the integrity check for the exact SHA.

## Consume a source

```sh
capabilities source add personal \
  git@github.com:alice/my-capabilities.git --ref main
capabilities source refresh personal
capabilities search --source personal
capabilities install my-service --source personal
```

Remote repositories use the caller's existing git/SSH authentication. The
manager stores no GitHub token. `search` reads the checked-in generated catalog
and never executes capability code. Installation independently checks the
catalog hash, generated-contract integrity, declaration snapshots, and bundle
layout before atomically replacing an installed payload. Authoring audit is an
explicit source/development operation.

To author an existing source on another machine, clone it into the same
canonical workspace shape instead of editing the manager cache:

```sh
capabilities source clone personal \
  git@github.com:alice/my-capabilities.git --ref main
capabilities source path personal
```

## Contract ownership

The source repository vendors `contract/preamble.py`; `contract/contract.json`
pins its checksum. The manager owns generated regions:

```sh
capabilities source sync personal
```

This deterministically updates the vendored authoring kit and restamps existing
regions. There is no force or skip-conformance flag. A tool that does not
follow this contract is still free to exist and run as an ordinary CLI, but
the capabilities manager will not install it as a managed capability.

## Repository shape

```text
capabilities.repo.json
AUTHORING.md
AGENTS.md
CLAUDE.md
contract/
  preamble.py
  contract.json
capabilities/
  <name>/
    bin/<name>
    guides/          optional
    service/         optional
    CHANGELOG.md    change log
    deviations.md   optional
.capability-source/
  catalog.json       generated
  manager-release.json  generated for the official manager source
```

The executable manifest remains the source of truth. `catalog.json` is only a
generated discovery index and is rejected when its summaries or payload hashes
are stale. In the official source, `manager-release.json` is also generated: it
binds the incoming manager and its complete runtime/authoring asset set to
SHA-256 hashes so `self-update` can stage the whole release before activation.
